  <h1>Chickens</h1>
  <h2>Crowing</h2>
  <p class = "firstP">"Cockadoodledoo" and "Cocka-doodle-doo" redirect here. For the nursery rhyme, see <em>Cock a doodle doo</em>.
    Roosters almost always start crowing before four months of age. Although it is possible for a hen to crow as well, crowing (together with hackles development) is one of the clearest signs of being a rooster.</p>
    <p>Rooster crowing contests are a traditional sport in several countries, such as Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium,[38] the United States, Indonesia and Japan. The oldest contests are held with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-crowing_chicken">longcrowers</a>. Depending on the breed, either the duration of the crowing or the times the rooster crows within a certain time is measured.</p>
  <h2>Courtship</h2>
  <p> To initiate courting, some roosters may dance in a circle around or near a hen (a circle dance), often lowering the wing which is closest to the hen.[39] The dance triggers a response in the hen[39] and when she responds to his call, the rooster may mount the hen and proceed with the mating.
  </p>
  <p>More <strong>specifically</strong>, mating typically involves the following sequence:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Male approaching the hen</li> 
    <li>Male pre-copulatory waltzing</li>
    <li>Male waltzing</li>
    <li>Female crouching (receptive posture) or stepping aside or running away (if unwilling to copulate)</li>
    <li>Male mounting</li>
    <li>Male treading with both feet on hen's back</li>
    <li>Male tail bending (following successful copulation)[40]</li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Nesting and laying behaviour</h2>
  <p>Hens will often try to lay in nests that already contain eggs and have been known to move eggs from neighbouring nests into their own. The result of this behaviour is that a flock will use only a few preferred locations, rather than having a different nest for every bird. Hens will often express a preference to lay in the same location. Two or more hens may try to share the same nest at the same time. If the nest is small or one of the hens is particularly determined, this may result in chickens trying to lay on top of each other. There is evidence that individual hens prefer to be either solitary or gregarious nesters.[41]</p>
